# Hot And Cold Game

In a 10 x 10 board, a player tries to find the target avoiding 4 mines randomly placed in the field. For each guess, 
the output is displayed on the board of either cold '-' or warm '+', when close to the target. If the target '$' is revealed, the player wins and loses
if encounters a mine 'X'.
